# Development procedure

[한국어](AGENTS.ko.md)

The working principles of every polyspec repository are in [PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md). This document states the rules of this repository only, each as a list item with its `Enforced by:` line.

<a id="workflow"></a>
## Required workflow

- Own: Read [documentation management](docs/operations/documentation-plan.md), the relevant [specification](docs/spec/json-contract.md) and [feature state](docs/features.md) before editing. Update the specification before a behavior change. Include the affected documents, feature state and changelog entries with the code change.
  Enforced by: `make docs-check`
- Own: Keep personal preferences, conversation context, credentials and backup locations outside Git.
  Enforced by: none, whether a tracked file holds a personal preference is a judgement.

<a id="feature-state"></a>
## Feature state

- Own: [Feature state](docs/features.md) is the feature record of this repository. The Implementation cell of each feature row holds one state: `implemented` (the listed behavior exists), `partial` (implementation in progress), `planned` (implementation not started), `shared-suite` (common JSON tests), `package-tests` (an implementation's own tests), `docs-tests` (documentation checker tests), `benchmark` (benchmark protocol and committed result), `source-only` (confirmed distribution) or `published` (a release tag and asset, which the row names).
  Enforced by: `make evidence-check`
- Own: A state stands only in its Implementation cell. `scripts/check-evidence.mts` fails on a state written anywhere else in `docs/features.md` or its translation, refuses a record without the feature table and refuses a row whose ID is not a feature ID `F-...`.
  Enforced by: `make evidence-check`
- Own: Each state names the record that backs it: the [records](docs/operations/validation.md#records) of the run that verifies a commit for `shared-suite`, `package-tests` and `docs-tests`, and the [benchmark result](benchmarks/results.json) for `benchmark`. A benchmark result is evidence only when it was measured from a clean checkout with the protocol and inputs that the workload declares.
  Enforced by: `make evidence-check`

<a id="generated-files"></a>
## Generated files

- Own: Generated files are never tracked in Git. They are dependency installs (`node_modules/`, `vendor/`, virtual environments), build output (`dist/`, `target/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`), caches (`.cache/`, `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/`), test run artifacts (`test-results/`, `playwright-report/`, PHPUnit caches) and tool downloads (`var/`). Each `.gitignore` covers these paths, and a new generator adds its ignore entry in the same commit.
  Enforced by: `make layout-check`
- Own: Only these files are tracked among generated ones: lock files (`package-lock.json`, `composer.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, uv locks, `mise.lock`), the committed generated documents that this file names, and test fixtures.
  Enforced by: `make layout-check`

<a id="checklist"></a>
## Execution checklist

- Own: The [execution checklist](docs/plans/execution/checklist.md) tracks the tasks of this repository that are not product features, such as checks, tools and CI. Each task is a row with an ID `T<wave>.<task>`. A new problem gets a new task, and a problem related to a task that is done gets a sub-item with the next derived ID (`T1.1-1`).
  Enforced by: `make docs-check`
- Own: A push happens only when no task is `[~]`.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review.
- Own: `make check` runs every target of `CHECK_TARGETS` through ci-targets of kit, past failures, and writes the report of each full run into `var/report/full-run`.
  Enforced by: `make check`

<a id="verification"></a>
## Required checks

- Own: Development runs unit tests only: the native test of a changed package, or a tool test with `make json-test-scripts TESTS=<file>`. `make verify-<language>` builds one implementation and sends the shared cases to its probe, and writes no record.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review.
- Own: The full suite (`make check`) and the end-to-end checks (`make pie-check`, `make owner-check`, the adapter suites and the supplementary suite) run in hosted CI on every pull request and every push to `main`. No rule requires a local run before a commit or a push, and no rule runs a broader check after each correction.
  Enforced by: `make ci-targets`
- Own: Every commit runs the commit-msg hook of `.githooks`, which refuses a message with the footer or the identity of an AI tool, because a commit message names no tool and no author but the person who commits. `make hooks` points `core.hooksPath` at `.githooks`, makes the hook executable and declares the merge drivers of the changelogs and the checklists; a checkout runs it once after its first install.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review: the hooks of a checkout are its local Git configuration, which no CI job sees; `make hooks-check` names a checkout that lacks them.
- Own: Every tracked path is owned by a rule of [config/owner-checks.json](config/owner-checks.json). `make owner-validate` fails while a path matches no rule, a glob matches no path or an owner does not exist. A new file is mapped in the same commit.
  Enforced by: `make layout-check`
- Own: A target that reads a record of another target names that target as its prerequisite, so it reads only the record of its own tree: `make verify-all` checks the PIE record of `make pie-check` and runs it first, and `pie-check` is no target of `CHECK_TARGETS` of its own.
  Enforced by: `make json-test-scripts`
- Own: Each target of `CHECK_TARGETS` in the Makefile is a prerequisite of the target of exactly one job of `.github/workflows/ci-pipeline.yml` (`kit-gates-static`, `kit-gates-verify`, `kit-gates-runtime-<runtime>`), which the job runs by name through `make ci-targets`, past failures, and uploads its report.
  Enforced by: `make json-test-scripts`
- Own: The lint of each language passes: `make lint-rust` (clippy with `-D warnings`), `make lint-go` (golangci-lint with `.golangci.yml`, and deadcode), `make lint-php` (phpcs with `phpcs.xml.dist`, and PHPStan) and `make lint-python` (ruff with `ruff.toml`, and vulture).
  Enforced by: `make ci-targets`
- Own: The PHP extension is rebuilt when its native code changes. A result from an old binary or a prior run is never taken as verification of changed code.
  Enforced by: `make test-php-ext`
- Own: A verification result or a source hash is never edited to make a check pass. A record of `var/records/` is written by the run that verifies it and is not committed.
  Enforced by: `make layout-check`

<a id="implementations"></a>
## Implementations and shared cases

- Own: [config/implementations.json](config/implementations.json) declares the implementations, which is the one source of the language set of this repository, with the directory of each. A new language is added in `config/implementations.json`, in the commands of `scripts/registry.mts` and in a package directory, without changing the shared JSON comparison algorithm.
  Enforced by: `make json-test-scripts`
- Own: Each implementation runs its own package tests with the native runner of its language: `make test-js`, `make test-rust`, `make test-go`, `make test-php`, `make test-php-ext` and `make test-python`.
  Enforced by: `make ci-targets`
- Own: An API that only one package provides is tested in that package. Shared cases exercise the JSON contract and cannot reach a language-specific API.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review: the shared cases reach only the JSON contract.
- Own: All language probes use [official.json](examples/official.json) and [scripts/verify.mts](scripts/verify.mts). Shared cases are added there or under `contracts/fixtures/`. No language-specific examples or expected results are created.
  Enforced by: `make verify-all`
- Own: A contract change updates the verifier and the affected packages in one repository revision. See the [repository contract](docs/operations/repositories.md).
  Enforced by: `make verify-all`

<a id="release"></a>
## Release

- Own: A release is a tag of a commit of `main` whose run of the `ci` workflow concluded with success, its job `kit / required` passed. The release workflow creates the tags; no tag is created, moved or pushed by hand.
  Enforced by: `make release-tag`
- Own: The version-bump commit `Release X.Y.Z` sets the version in every manifest that `config/release.json` releases and in the binding packages, which `binding scaffold` writes again from the version of the core, updates `Cargo.lock` with cargo, and renames `## Unreleased` of each changelog to `## X.Y.Z`.
  Enforced by: none; judged at review.
- Own: A Go module tag is created with `vX.Y.Z` on the same commit for each Go module of `config/release.json`; it names none while the legacy Go module keeps its last release and the Go module of the bindings is not released.
  Enforced by: `make release-tag`
- Own: A successful run of the `ci` workflow on `main` runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which releases the top `## X.Y.Z` at the commit of that run when it is the version commit, or a later commit whose `## Unreleased` is empty while the version is untagged.
  Enforced by: `make release-tag`
- Own: After the tag push, the version of the tag is in every manifest that `config/release.json` releases and the section `## X.Y.Z` is in `CHANGELOG.md`, then release.yml builds the archives and the Python wheel and creates the GitHub Release.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review.
- Own: A package that pins a package of another repository names only a tag that exists on GitHub. The pin is written after that tag is pushed.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review.
- Own: After a release the repository holds the branch `main` alone, locally and on the remote. A line of development, such as `v1/rust-core`, is merged into `main` for its release and is then deleted with its worktrees and every other branch beside `main`, because a branch that remains after a release holds commits that no release and no CI run of `main` covers.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review.

<a id="tools"></a>
## Shared tools

- Own: The tools that every polyspec repository shares are the package `@polyspec/kit`, a devDependency pinned in `package-lock.json`. The Makefile holds every recipe of this repository and runs the utilities of the installed package (`node_modules/@polyspec/kit/dist`) with explicit arguments; it includes no recipe of kit. The settings of the tools are in their own files: `.npmrc`, the `[settings]` and `[env]` of `mise.toml`, the lint configurations at the root and the `[workspace.lints]` of the root `Cargo.toml`. `PRINCIPLES.md`, the workflows of `.github/workflows`, `.github/actions/kit-bootstrap/action.yml` and `config/layout.kit.yml` are files of this repository, taken from kit, which writes no copy (kit docs/spec/utilities-and-recipes.md).
  Enforced by: none, judged at review: kit checks no recipe or file of a repository.
- Own: The folder layout of this repository is `config/layout.yml`, which extends `config/layout.kit.yml` with the folders of this repository.
  Enforced by: `make layout-check`

<a id="dependencies"></a>
## Dependencies

- Own: While polyspec versions are 0.0.x, development checkouts link installed polyspec packages to their source as kit `docs/plans/local-links.md` describes. Links are never committed.
  Enforced by: none, a development link is kept out of Git by the ignored `node_modules/`, and no tool judges a development checkout.
- Own: The tool binding is the npm package `@polyspec/binding`, the asset of a GitHub Release of binding, which `package.json` names by its URL and `package-lock.json` pins by its integrity. Its release is the release whose tag every dependency line on `polyspec-binding-core` names, so that the tool and the crate that it generates code for are one release. `make bindings` runs it for the five targets and `make bindings-check` runs its contract check, which reads the crates that `make install` fetched.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review: no CI job runs the contract check yet, which reports CK-20 while the lock pins another release of binding.

<a id="idempotency"></a>
## Idempotency

- Own: The same tree gives the same result at any time and on any machine. Each rule of this list names how this repository meets the rule.
  Enforced by: none, whether a result depends on the machine is a judgement that no tool makes.
- Own: A check makes no registry query whose result depends on time: no latest lookup, no `@latest`, no resolution of a version range and no query about outdated packages. Installing what a lock pins by exact version and integrity hash is allowed, as `npm ci` and `composer install` are.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review.
- Own: No command installs a tool on demand. Node.js, Rust, Go, Python, PHP and npm are pinned by tracked files: Go, Python, Composer and the other tools of `mise.toml` are exact releases locked by digests in `mise.lock`, and PHP is pinned by its minor release in `.php-version`. Every command except the install targets run cargo, go, npm and Composer offline, so a missing download fails with a message to run `make install`.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review: kit 0.0.77 removed toolchain check (K854), and the pins of mise.toml and mise.lock are read by install-tools.
- Own: Only `make bootstrap`, `make install-tools TOOLS=npm`, `make install-packages` and `make install` download. A fresh checkout runs them in this order: `make bootstrap` installs `package-lock.json`, `@polyspec/kit` included, with the npm release of `devEngines.packageManager`, run outside the checkout, because the bootstrap that `make install-tools TOOLS=npm` runs is a file of the installed kit; `make install-tools TOOLS=npm` installs npm, `make install-packages` the packages of `package-lock.json`, and `make install` the tools of `mise.lock`, the Rust toolchain, and the crates of the root `Cargo.lock`; the PIE PHAR and the supplementary suite are the tools `http:pie` and `http:jsontestsuite` of `mise.toml`.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review: the crates of a Cargo.lock are the state of cargo, which a make target cannot compare with the lock (K864).
- Own: A test reads only the outputs it creates and does not depend on untracked state. Records, documentation checks, shared cases and build copies read the files Git tracks, and each run builds in its own run directory with its own `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.
  Enforced by: `make json-test-scripts`
- Own: A shared output is published atomically: it is written completely to a file in `var/` and renamed over its path (`write_record`).
  Enforced by: `make json-test-scripts`
- Own: A check never judges a message in the user's locale. A command whose output text is compared runs with `LC_ALL=C`, as `scripts/registry.mts` runs `git ls-files`.
  Enforced by: `make json-test-scripts`

<a id="completion"></a>
## Completion

- Own: A distribution status is updated only with observed evidence, and the check of a publication is separate from the tests.
  Enforced by: `make evidence-check`
- Own: Review code and tests to confirm the accuracy of a document. Automated link, revision and status checks do not establish the accuracy of prose.
  Enforced by: none, the accuracy of prose is a judgement that no tool makes.
- Own: Git messages are factual and concise, and unrelated changes are committed separately.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review.

<a id="package-npm"></a>
## Package npm (legacy/packages/js)

- Own: The package `@polyspec/ordered-json` is checked alone by `make json-js-check`, which runs `make verify-js` (`scripts/verify.mts --only js`) and compares its adapter with the shared cases and writes no record. Its package tests are native node:test files that `make test-js` runs.
  Enforced by: `make test-js`
- Own: The package keeps no independent goldens: official cases and expected results belong to the repository root, and a behavior change updates the common specification before the package.
  Enforced by: `make verify-all`
- Own: The changes of the package are listed in its section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), and its documents are checked with the others.
  Enforced by: `make docs-check`

<a id="package-rust"></a>
## Package rust (packages/rust)

- Own: The crate is linted by `make lint-rust` (clippy with `-D warnings`).
  Enforced by: `make lint-rust`
- Own: Every crate of the workspace, the binding packages included, is in the form of rustfmt, because a review cannot judge that form by reading.
  Enforced by: `make fmt-check`
- Own: The crate is checked alone by `make json-rust-check`, which runs `make verify-rust`.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review: no workflow, Git hook or Claude Code hook runs this target.
- Own: Its crates are the locked versions of the root `Cargo.lock`, which `make install` downloads; no check downloads them.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review: the crates of a Cargo.lock are the state of cargo, which a make target cannot compare with the lock (K864).
- Own: Its package tests are the native tests of the crate that `make test-rust` runs.
  Enforced by: `make test-rust`
- Own: The changes of the crate are listed in its section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
  Enforced by: `make docs-check`

<a id="package-go"></a>
## Package go (legacy/packages/go)

- Own: The module is linted by `make lint-go` (golangci-lint with `.golangci.yml`, and deadcode).
  Enforced by: `make lint-go`
- Own: The module is checked alone by `make json-go-check`, which runs `make verify-go`.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review: no workflow, Git hook or Claude Code hook runs this target.
- Own: `GOTOOLCHAIN` is `local`, and the module requires the Go release of `mise.toml`.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review: kit 0.0.77 removed toolchain check (K854), and the pins of mise.toml and mise.lock are read by install-tools.
- Own: Its package tests are the Go tests beside the code that `make test-go` runs.
  Enforced by: `make test-go`
- Own: The changes of the module are listed in its section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
  Enforced by: `make docs-check`

<a id="package-php"></a>
## Package php (legacy/packages/php)

- Own: The Composer package is linted by `make lint-php` (phpcs and PHPStan).
  Enforced by: `make lint-php`
- Own: The Composer package is checked alone by `make json-php-check`, which runs `make verify-php`.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review: no workflow, Git hook or Claude Code hook runs this target.
- Own: Its `composer.lock` is locked to the platform `8.4.1` and requires PHP `>=8.4`, and is re-locked with `composer update --lock` when its manifest changes.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review.
- Own: Its package tests are the PHPUnit tests of `legacy/packages/php/tests` that `make test-php` runs, installed by `make install`.
  Enforced by: `make test-php`
- Own: The changes of the package are listed in its section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
  Enforced by: `make docs-check`

<a id="package-php-ext"></a>
## Package php-ext (legacy/packages/php-ext)

- Own: The extension is checked alone by `make json-php-ext-check`, which runs `make verify-php-extension`. `make build-php-ext` of kit (S10) builds `var/php-ext/polyspec_ordered_json.so` from the stub and its tracked arginfo header (`make php-ext-arginfo` writes it), and `make verify-php-extension` and `make test-php-ext` load it.
  Enforced by: `make test-php-ext`
- Own: Its `composer.lock` is locked to the platform `8.4.1` and requires PHP `>=8.4`, the same as the PHP package, and is re-locked with `composer update --lock` when its manifest changes.
  Enforced by: none, judged at review.
- Own: The changes of the extension are listed in its section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
  Enforced by: `make docs-check`

<a id="package-python"></a>
## Package python (legacy/packages/python)

- Own: The package is checked alone by `make json-python-check`, which runs `make verify-python`, and linted by `make lint-python` (ruff with `ruff.toml`, and vulture with `legacy/packages/python/vulture_whitelist.py`). `make install-packages` installs it editable into `legacy/packages/python/.venv`, which its tests use.
  Enforced by: `make lint-python`
- Own: Its package tests are the unittest tests of `legacy/packages/python/tests` that `make test-python` runs.
  Enforced by: `make test-python`
- Own: The changes of the package are listed in its section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
  Enforced by: `make docs-check`
