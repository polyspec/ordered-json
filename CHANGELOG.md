## Unreleased

- The Python parser builds the scalar value of a member or an item in one method (T2.11): `_nested_scalar` replaces the two inlined copies, and the locals that only they used are gone; the behavior is unchanged. Red: `make duplication-check` exit 2, 10 clones, 1 in `packages/python/src`; green: 9 clones, none in `packages/python/src`; unittest of `packages/python/tests` 39 tests OK, `scripts/verify.mts --only python` passed, `make lint-python` passed; `benchmarks/python-parse/run.py` ratio 2.57 to 2.90 (limit 3.0) after, 2.40 to 2.99 before.
- The PHP package encodes a code point as UTF-8 in one function (T2.10): `codePointToUtf8` serves `unitsToUtf8` and `tokenText`; the behavior is unchanged. Red: `make duplication-check` exit 2, 11 clones, 1 in `packages/php/src`; green: 10 clones, none in `packages/php/src`; PHPUnit of `packages/php` 35 tests OK, `scripts/verify.mts --only php` passed, `make lint-php` passed.
- The Go package states each piece of code once (T2.9): `marshalList` writes the elements of a slice and an array, and `writeShortEscape` writes the escapes of a JSON string for `writeString` and `StringFromUnits`; the behavior is unchanged. Red: `make duplication-check` exit 2, 13 clones, 2 in `packages/go`; green: 11 clones, none in `packages/go`; `go test ./...` ok, `scripts/verify.mts --only go` 17 official examples + 98 shared cases passed, `make lint-go` passed.
- The PHP extension takes the names of the S10 standard (T2.8): the PIE package is `polyspec/ordered-json-php-ext` (the release asset `polyspec-ordered-json-php-ext-php-X.Y.Z.zip`), the extension and its module are `polyspec_ordered_json`, `PHP_NEW_EXTENSION` and `--enable-polyspec-ordered-json` follow, the stub is `src/polyspec_ordered_json.stub.php`, and the library, the tests, the verifier and the parity declaration load `polyspec_ordered_json`. The arginfo header stays open: `make php-ext-arginfo` fails in kit. Red: `make lint-php-ext` exit 2, 4 findings; the shared probe refused the unrenamed `extension_loaded('ordered_json')` (`Unexpected PHP parser backend`, 1 of 115 cases); green: `scripts/verify.mts --only php-extension` 17 official examples + 98 shared cases passed, registry and evidence tests 17 passed, `make lint-php-ext` 1 finding left (the arginfo header).
- `config/rebuild.json` declares the class of each tool of `scripts/*.mts` (T2.6): ecosystem for mdast, PIE, ajv and momoa, policy for the verifier, its registry, its records and `present`, and replaced for `external-inputs.mts`, which item T2.7 moves to the http backend of mise. Red: `make rebuild-check` exit 2, `config/rebuild.json does not exist`; green: exit 0, `every tool that config/rebuild.json selects has its class`.
- The Korean twin of the kit-standard checklist carries the revision of its English source (T2.5): the translation was compared with the English rows, which match, and `make documents-stamp` wrote the source-sha256. Red: `make docs-check` exit 2, `1 findings in 25 document pairs` (revision); green: exit 0.
- The parity units cite the requirements RQ-001 to RQ-024 of the JSON contract (kit K273), the JavaScript probe runs from `packages/js/tests/probe.mjs` after the move of its folder, and the workflow tests leave the workflows that kit vendors out (T2.3).
- The packages keep no AGENTS, CHANGELOG or Makefile (T2.2): each package has a section in the root `AGENTS.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`, its check and test are targets of the root Makefile (`ordered-json-<package>-check` and `ordered-json-<package>-test`), and the layout exception of `config/layout.yml` is removed. The PHP platform of every Composer manifest is 8.4.1 and the Composer locks are locked again. The recipes that the Makefile lost in T2.1 are restored (`verify-*`, `verify-all`, `typecheck`, `evidence-check`, `release-config-check`, `pie-check`, `benchmark`, `benchmark-check`, `ordered-json-test-scripts` and `ordered-json-install-external`). The checklist has the parent row T1.29, and the comparison product is no longer named in the changelogs and the checklist.
- The repository follows the kit standard 0.0.54 (T2.1): the execution checklist moves to `docs/plans/execution/`, the documents and the test folder move to the folders of the layout (`docs/operations/documentation-plan.md`, `docs/operations/proposals.md`, `packages/js/tests`), `install` runs the bootstrap of kit as `install-kit` before `ordered-json-install`, the workflow `.github/workflows/gates.yml` is vendored from kit, and the comparison tools with another project are removed with their report.
- T1.58: AGENTS points to the local links of kit `docs/plans/local-links.md`: while polyspec versions are 0.0.x, development checkouts link installed polyspec packages to their source, and links are never committed.
- T1.57: the shared tools are `@polyspec/kit` 0.0.53.
- T1.56: the shared tools are `@polyspec/kit` 0.0.52: `.php-version` declares the PHP 8.5 that every workflow sets up, and the release workflow runs `make kit-check` before any release step (kit K193).
- T1.55: the shared tools are `@polyspec/kit` 0.0.50: knip reads the binaries that the scripts and tests run from `binaries` of `config/knip-entries.json` (kit K176), and `make dependency-policy-check` checks the root `composer.json` with its committed `composer.lock`, which locks no package, as it checks every Composer manifest of the checkout (kit K181).
- T1.54: the Composer locks of `packages/php` and `packages/php-ext` are current again: the version 0.0.9 of T1.50 changed the content hash of both manifests without a new lock. `config/dependency-policy.json` declares both Composer projects with PHP 8.5.0, so `make dependency-policy-check` fails on a lock that `composer validate --strict` finds stale and reviews their PHPUnit and their locks; both locks keep every package version.
- T1.53: `make lint-python`, the ruff and vulture of kit, runs in the full suite and in the docs job of CI; the comparison probe in `scripts/comparison` no longer changes `sys.path` (S3), and its environment installs the package with the uv of `mise.toml` and runs the probe with its Python (`--python`).
- T1.52: `make lint-php`, the phpcs and PHPStan of kit, runs in the full suite and in the suite job of CI; `make install-php` installs the root package into `vendor/`, whose autoloader PHPStan reads for the PHP of `benchmarks/`, and the PHP of the packages, the tests and the benchmarks follows PSR-12, the probe of the shared verifier reading its serializations from `Polyspec\OrderedJson\Tests\ProbeTree`.
- T1.51: the shared tools are `@polyspec/kit` 0.0.48: the checkout runs the Node.js 26.12.0 of `mise.toml` from `var/tools`, `.node-version` is gone and every `engines.node` is `>=26.12.0` (kit K171); the workflows pin each action by its SHA with its version (kit K169); the scripts and tests read JSON through schemas and check the values that they read instead of asserting them (kit K155–K158).

### npm (packages/js)

- Text input with an unpaired surrogate is rejected with `unescaped_lone_surrogate` at the offset of the surrogate, before the grammar is read; it named the unit after the surrogate, and a surrogate after the root was `trailing_input` (T1.39).

### python (packages/python)

- The parser reads a document in one pass of compiled `re` patterns, one match per member, item or root value,
  and decodes member names and `string_value()` with `bytes.decode` and `json.decoder.scanstring` (T1.41). On 50,000
  flat objects its CPU time fell from 4.44 to 2.34-2.94 times the pure PHP parser; results and error offsets are
  unchanged.

- `parse_bytes` validates UTF-8 with `bytes.decode('utf-8')` instead of a byte-by-byte check in Python (T1.35). The
  rejection is `invalid_utf8` at the
  `start` of the `UnicodeDecodeError`, the same offset as before, and the `ParseError` is raised from that error.

- The package implements the shared JSON contract (T1.27-2): `parse` and `parse_bytes` read text and UTF-8 bytes,
  `stringify` and `Value.compact()` serialize, `Value` exposes the accessors and factories, and `ParseError` reports
  the shared rejection kinds at UTF-8 byte offsets, with `max_depth` and `reject_duplicates` following the JavaScript
  binding. The package tests run the standard cases and its own cases, and the registry, the package test standard
  and the owner map of the repository cover the package.

## 0.0.9

- T1.49: the Composer manifest of `packages/php-ext` declares no `repositories` and no development requirement of `polyspec/ordered-json`; its tests load the PHP library from `../php/src` by `autoload-dev`, so the release zip of the extension carries a manifest that installs outside the repository.
- T1.48: the shared tools are `@polyspec/kit` 0.0.45, whose knip ignores the binaries of the pinned runtimes (kit K152).
- T1.46: `make lint-ts`, the oxlint and knip of kit, runs in the full suite and in the docs job of CI; `config/knip-entries.json` declares the JavaScript probe `packages/js/test/probe.mjs`, which the shared verifier runs, as an entry of knip (kit K145).
- T1.47: the shared tools are `@polyspec/kit` 0.0.44: `make install-tools` installs the Rust toolchain of `rust-toolchain.toml`, which the docs job of CI lacked, ruff keeps its cache in `var/ruff`, and `config/layout.yml` adds `composer.json` and `external-inputs.json` to the root files of kit instead of repeating its list (kit K145, K147, K150, K151).
- T1.45: the shared tools are `@polyspec/kit` 0.0.43: parity reads the trials of libtest-mimic and the data sets of a PHPUnit test method, `no-floating-promises` allows the registrations of node:test, API Extractor no longer reports `ae-missing-release-tag`, and knip takes its entries from the layout.
- T1.42: the repository tools are TypeScript (S9): the shared verifier (`scripts/verify.mts` with its registry, reference and records), the evidence, PIE, external-input and comparison checks and the benchmark runner run with Node.js, are checked by `make typecheck`, and their tests are node tests of `tests/scripts` (`make test-scripts`). The independent reference reads JSON with momoa. The package tests left the verifier for the native runners of kit parity, kit's `lint-rust` and `lint-go` replace `scripts/lint.py`, and the job `python` of CI is gone. The package folders are read from `config/parity.json` and the fixture folder from the registry; the only Python left of the tools is the probe of a Python library in `scripts/comparison`, an exception of S9 with its reason.
- T1.39: every unit runs in each implementation of its profile, with no exclusion. `ordered_map_rejects_non_string_key` runs in JavaScript too and shares the profile `no-php` with the byte input, since PHP arrays key by string or integer; `utf8_validation_holds_for_long_multibyte_text` (formerly `utf8_validation_survives_low_pcre_limits`) runs in every implementation, PHP under low PCRE limits; `text_input_rejects_lone_surrogates` and the new `string_value_keeps_an_unpaired_surrogate` form the profile `utf16-text` of JavaScript and Python. JavaScript text input with an unpaired surrogate is rejected before its grammar, at the offset of the surrogate instead of the unit after it, and a surrogate after the root is `unescaped_lone_surrogate` instead of `trailing_input`, as in Python.
- T1.43: `config/parity.json` binds every API unit to the public symbol of JavaScript that the TypeScript extractor of kit reads from `packages/js/index.d.ts`, as the tables of the API contract name them (the compact output and the UTF-16 construction and lookup are `stringify`, `Value.string` and `get`), and declares the JavaScript-only symbols `Kind`, `ParseOptions`, `rejectDuplicates`, `keys`, `toJSON` and `toString` as native-only with their reasons.
- T1.38: the package tests run with the native runners that kit parity runs, each test bound to its unit of `config/parity.json`: JavaScript with node:test (`packages/js/test/api.test.mjs`, `official.test.mjs`), Python with unittest in `packages/python/.venv`, which `make install-python` makes (`tests/test_api.py`, `test_official.py`), and PHP with PHPUnit 13.4.2, which `make install-php` installs into `packages/php` and `packages/php-ext` (`ValueApiTest` of both backends from `ValueApiTestCase`, `DescriptorTest`, `ValueClassTest`); `make php-extension` builds the extension in place for `make parity-check`. Every implementation runs the official examples natively, one case per example: JavaScript and Python by their package tests, Go by `TestOfficial`, Rust by the trials of libtest-mimic 0.8.2 in `tests/official.rs` (`official::<id>`), and PHP by the data sets of `testCase` of `OfficialTestCase`, which `OfficialTest` of each backend runs. The PHP classes `Value`, `ParseError`, `Tape` and `Parser` load by PSR-4 from a file each, the functions and `MAX_DEPTH` by `files` (S2), and the release smoke of the wheel requires its `py.typed` marker.
- T1.42: the folders follow S5 of kit's layout. The packages and the shared fixtures moved; a consumer takes the new paths when it moves past this release:
  - `packages/ordered-json-go` → `packages/go`: the Go module `github.com/polyspec/ordered-json/packages/ordered-json-go` is `github.com/polyspec/ordered-json/packages/go`, and its tags are `packages/go/vX.Y.Z` instead of `packages/ordered-json-go/vX.Y.Z`.
  - `packages/ordered-json-npm` → `packages/js`; the npm package `@polyspec/ordered-json` and its archive name are unchanged.
  - `packages/ordered-json-php` → `packages/php` and `packages/ordered-json-php-ext` → `packages/php-ext`; the Composer names and archive names are unchanged.
  - `packages/ordered-json-python` → `packages/python`: a Git source names `subdirectory=packages/python`.
  - `packages/ordered-json-rust` → `packages/rust`.
  - `fixtures/` → `contracts/fixtures/`.
- T1.44: the shared tools are `@polyspec/kit` 0.0.42. Go, Python with uv, Composer, alint, ruff, vulture, golangci-lint, deadcode, govulncheck and cargo-audit are tools of `mise.toml` at exact releases, Go and Python at the pins of kit, locked by their digests in `mise.lock` and installed by `make install-tools` into `var/tools/mise`; `config/toolchain.json` keeps the release of mise, and `.python-version` is removed. CI installs them with `make install-tools` instead of setup-python and the Composer of setup-php, and the workflow rule refuses `TOOLS` other than `npm` and a setup action of Go or Python. The sprintf-js advisory that kit brings is accepted as kit accepts it.
- T1.41: the Python parser reads a document in one pass of compiled `re` patterns, one match per member, item or root value, with the grammar defined once for the scan and for every error offset; `make python-parse-budget` compares its CPU time with the pure PHP parser on 50,000 flat objects, where the ratio fell from 4.44 to 2.34-2.94. Results and error offsets are unchanged on every vector.
- T1.37: `config/parity.json` is the one declaration of the implementations, their cases and their public API, read by the parity check of `@polyspec/kit` (`make parity-declarations-check`, `make parity-check`); `implementations.json` and `package-tests.json` are removed. The verifier reads the implementations from it and keeps their commands in `scripts/registry.py`, the case and symbol listings of the packages are removed, and the rejection kinds are listed in the JSON contract.
- T1.36: the shared tools are the package `@polyspec/kit` (a devDependency pinned by its release asset) instead of the vendored `scripts/kit/` and `tests/kit/`; a new checkout runs `make install-tools TOOLS=npm` and `make install-packages` first. `make kit-sync` writes the copies of the package, `config/layout.yml` maps the folders for `make layout-check`, and the toolchain floors are the pins of kit: Node.js 26.11.1, PHP 8.5, Go 1.27.2 and Rust 1.99.0.

- T1.35: `parse_bytes` of the Python package validates UTF-8 with `bytes.decode('utf-8')` instead of a byte-by-byte check in Python, and reports `invalid_utf8` at the `start` of the `UnicodeDecodeError`, the same offset as before; the `ParseError` is raised from that error.

- T1.34-1: the jobs `python` and `push-gate` install uv with the Python (`make install-tools TOOLS="uv python"`), and the workflow rule refuses a step that installs python without uv.

- T1.34: the vendored tools of kit are v0.0.28 (`make kit-sync KIT_TAG=v0.0.28`). `config/toolchain.json` declares `uv` 0.12.24, and `make install-tools` installs the Python of `pythonBuild` (3.14.8) with `uv python install` into `var/tools/uv-python`, keeping the symbolic links that uv creates; `pythonBuild` declares only the exact version. The Python package has the lock `packages/ordered-json-python/pylock.toml` (no dependency), and the release workflow proves a draft release before it makes it public (`make release-proof`, `make release-undraft`).

- T1.33: AGENTS states that an existing outside tool or library is used as it is and not rebuilt, with uv for Python interpreters, environments and locks and Composer for PHP dependencies as examples, and accepts the symbolic links that such a tool creates. It also states that the symbolic link and relative path rules of this repository, where they exist, govern what this repository creates, and that paths are resolved declaratively or by a stated discovery rule.

- T1.32-6-1: `docs/distribution.json` is removed. It restated the GitHub releases, the version tags and the source visibility, which no check compared with the repository, so it went stale after each release. A feature row marked `published` names its release tag and asset, and `make evidence-check` checks that form offline. `make release-proof TAG=<tag>` is the networked comparison of a release.

- T1.32-5: the distribution document and the root `README.md` no longer state that no release exists or that the first release is unpublished. They name where the releases are listed (`gh release list -R polyspec/ordered-json` and the Releases page) and what a `vX.Y.Z` release attaches.

- T1.32-4: the distribution documents, the installation document and `AGENTS.md` name the Python package as its wheel asset `polyspec_ordered_json-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl` instead of a git tag. The Python package README installs that wheel asset. The release procedure states that the Go tag `packages/ordered-json-go/vX.Y.Z` is pushed before `vX.Y.Z` on the same commit.

- T1.32-3: the vendored tools of kit are v0.0.20 (`make kit-sync KIT_TAG=v0.0.20`); `make kit-test` passes on the vendored tests.

- T1.32-2: the Python package states `requires-python = ">=3.14"`, the minor release of `.python-version` that CI runs under the pinned interpreter. The job python of `ci.yml` has no 3.11 matrix entry and no `PYTHON` override, and `scripts/tests/test_python_requires.py` checks the declared range against `.python-version`.

## 0.0.8

- T1.32: the Python package is released as its wheel `polyspec_ordered_json-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl`, built with the pinned build backend `setuptools==84.0.0` (`buildBackend`) and installed from the release asset instead of the git tag. The README and the installation document show the `pip install` line of the wheel URL.

## 0.0.7

- T1.31: the push of a tag does not start `push-gate.yml` (`push: branches: ['**']`), so the release verifies the check `push-gate` of the commit without a second queued run; `test_a_tag_push_starts_none_of_the_workflows_whose_checks_the_release_requires` requires it.
- T1.29-1: the push gate, the full-run guard, the owner check and the CI report are the vendored tools of kit v0.0.4 (`scripts/kit/`, `tests/kit/`, `.kit/kit.lock.json`), configured in `config/checklist.json` and `config/owner-checks.json`. `push_gate.py`, `full_run.py`, `owner_check.py`, `ci_run.py` and their tests are removed. The jobs of `ci.yml` and `push-gate.yml` run `make ci-targets`, and `test_workflow_rules` requires every target of `CHECK_TARGETS` to run in exactly one job. A `partial` feature no longer stops a push or a full run.
- T1.29-2: the release steps are the kit tool `scripts/kit/release.mjs`, configured in `config/release.json`; `release.py`, `install_fixtures.py` and `test_release.py` are removed. The archives of the npm package of `packages/ordered-json-npm/` and of the Composer packages of `packages/ordered-json-php/` and `packages/ordered-json-php-ext/` are named `polyspec-ordered-json-npm-X.Y.Z.tgz`, `polyspec-ordered-json-php-X.Y.Z.zip` and `polyspec-ordered-json-extension-php-X.Y.Z.zip`. `make release-coverage` requires every package file to be classified, and `make release-config-check` runs the step `versions` for the version of `packages/ordered-json-npm/package.json`. The consumer projects of the archives are in `tests/release-consumer`; `make release-consumer-lock` writes their locks on the release commit. The Go module tag is `packages/ordered-json-go/vX.Y.Z`, and `make release-verify` requires it at the commit of `vX.Y.Z`.
- T1.29-3: the documents are checked by `scripts/kit/check-documents.mjs` (`make documents-check`, `config/documents.json`) and the commit messages by `scripts/kit/check-commits.mjs` (`make commits-check`, `config/commits.json`). The document manifests are removed; the `doc-id` marker of each package document starts with `npm-`, `php-`, `php-ext-`, `python-`, `rust-` or `go-`, because a marker names one document of the repository. `docs_check.py` is `scripts/check_evidence.py` (`make evidence-check`), which keeps the checks of the feature rows against their evidence, the distribution observations, the benchmark result, the verification records and the JSON reports, and `test_docs_check.py` is `test_check_evidence.py`. A checklist row writes the states in words.
- T1.29-4: the toolchains are declared in `config/toolchain.json`, `.node-version`, the `packageManager` of `package.json`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.php-version` and `.python-version`, and checked by `make toolchain-check` and `make cargo-downloads-check` (kit tools); `make install` installs npm and Go into `var/tools`, the Rust toolchain, the crates and the PIE PHAR and supplementary suite of `external-inputs.json`, and is the only target that downloads. `toolchains.py` and `test.py` are removed: the installs of the external inputs are `scripts/external_inputs.py`, the verifier unit test runner is `scripts/unit_tests.py` (`make test-scripts`) and the aggregate verification is `scripts/verification.py` (`make verify-all`). The flag `--build-extension` is removed. The workflows run `make install`, and the release workflow runs `make install-tools` with Node.js only.
- T1.29-5: the dependencies are gated by `make dependency-policy-check` (`scripts/kit/check-dependency-policy.mjs`) against `config/dependency-policy.json` and the review record `config/dependency-review.json` that `make dependency-review RECORD=1` writes. The root `package.json` has the lock `package-lock.json`. The scripts `test` of `package.json`, `packages/ordered-json-npm/package.json` and `packages/ordered-json-php/composer.json` run `make verify-js` and `make verify-php`. AGENTS states the dependency rule. `make dependency-policy-mutation-check` fails with a TypeError because the repository has no npm registry dependency and no Composer platform for its mutations to change.
- T1.29-6: the packages are in `packages/ordered-json-npm`, `packages/ordered-json-php`, `packages/ordered-json-php-ext`, `packages/ordered-json-python`, `packages/ordered-json-rust` and `packages/ordered-json-go`. The Go module path is `github.com/polyspec/ordered-json/packages/ordered-json-go` and its tag is `packages/ordered-json-go/vX.Y.Z`.
- T1.29-7: AGENTS states that the tools of `scripts/kit/` and `tests/kit/` change only in polyspec/kit, that this repository differs from another polyspec repository only in `config/*.json` and its own product code, the 0.x rule without pull request, merge queue or ruleset, and the archive names `<package>-<language>-<version>.<ext>`. The release 0.0.7 is prepared: the manifests are not bumped, no tag exists, and `make release-config-check`, `make release-coverage` and `make dependency-policy-check` pass for the layout of `packages/`.
- T1.29-8: `config/toolchain.json` declares Composer 2.10.3. The job `docs` of `ci.yml` sets up PHP and that Composer release for `make dependency-policy-check`, and `make kit-test` runs in the job `suite`.
- T1.29-9: the vendored tools of kit are v0.0.8.
- T1.29-10: `make dependency-policy-mutation-check` runs in CI and passes. `make install` installs the Rust toolchain before the tools, and the release workflow installs npm only.
- T1.30: the test `test_both_tag_shapes_start_the_release_and_the_release_steps_handle_both` requires the tag filters of the release workflow to match `vX.Y.Z` and `packages/ordered-json-go/vX.Y.Z`, and AGENTS states that the Go tag is pushed first or with `vX.Y.Z`.

## 0.0.6

- T1.27-25: the release archives are named `<package>-<language>-<version>.<ext>`: the npm archive `polyspec-ordered-json-npm-X.Y.Z.tgz`, the PHP archives `polyspec-ordered-json-php-X.Y.Z.zip` and `polyspec-ordered-json-extension-php-X.Y.Z.zip`.

## 0.0.5

- T1.27-18: the release version test checks the tag of the version that `js/package.json` declares, instead of the fixed tag v0.0.3, which the 0.0.4 bump had made stale.
- T1.27-19: the CI workflow runs on every push to main, so each main commit has the check ci-passed that the release workflow requires.
- T1.27-21: AGENTS.md states the 0.x rule: a change is committed to main after its owning unit test passes locally, and the CI push trigger gives the ci-passed check of each main commit.
- T1.27-22: AGENTS.md states the pin rule: a pin of another repository's package names only a tag that exists on GitHub.
- T1.27-23: the GitHub ruleset and the merge queue are removed; the workflows run on push and pull_request, and the release requires ci-passed on the tagged commit.
- T1.27-17: the consumer fixtures of the release asset install test name the 0.0.4 archives, written by `make install-fixtures`.
## 0.0.4

- On PR #1, `ci-passed` passes after the fixes of T1.27-10 to T1.27-13: the docs, python, push-gate and suite jobs pass on the same commit (T1.27-14).
- The `python` job of CI uploads `var/ci/python/`, the report that `make ci CI_JOB=python` writes, instead of `var/ci/python-<minor>/`, which no target writes; `scripts/tests/test_workflow_rules.py` requires each report path to be the directory of its make target (T1.27-13).
- The push-gate job passes on the committed tree: its exit status 2 came from `make docs-check` in the job, which read the stale translation revisions that T1.27-10 synced, so `scripts/push_gate.py` and `.github/workflows/push-gate.yml` are unchanged (T1.27-12).
- The test test_the_job_fails_on_a_commit_whose_documentation_check_fails passes on the committed tree: its failure came from the stale translation revisions that T1.27-10 fixed, so neither the test nor the code under test changed (T1.27-11).
- The translations of AGENTS, the execution checklist and the changelog state the revision of their English documents again, so the documentation check of the docs job passes: the commit of T1.27-9 changed the English documents without updating the revision (T1.27-10).
- The toolchain download tests run a fake `cargo` on `PATH` for a failed fetch, a successful fetch and a missing `cargo`, so their results do not depend on the `cargo` installed on the machine (T1.27-8).
- Set the `package-data` key of the Python package to `polyspec.ordered_json`, so the `py.typed` marker ships in the wheel, and added `python/tests/package_data.py` to the Python checks (T1.27-9).
- The Python documents state the current facts only (T1.27-7): the installation document and the README show the placeholder `vX.Y.Z` for the first tag that contains `python/`, and the checklist row T1.27-3 names the Python registry state `not-verified` that `docs/distribution.json` records.
- The `python` job of CI pins `actions/upload-artifact` to a commit that GitHub holds, and `scripts/tests/test_workflow_rules.py` requires every action of every workflow to keep one full commit id (T1.27-6).
- The README and the installation document name the Python package (T1.27-5): the README(.ko) lists it in its intro, its package table and its start section, which runs the example from `python/src`; the pip install line and the installation document show the placeholder `vX.Y.Z` for the first tag that contains `python/`, and no released tag contains it yet.
- CI runs the Python package on both supported minors (T1.27-4): the job `python` of `ci.yml` has the matrix
  3.11 and the minor release of `.python-version` and runs `make ci CI_JOB=python`, the package tests, the case
  listing and the symbol report with the interpreter of the job (`scripts/python_check.py`, which checks no
  tool pin because the floor minor is below it); `ci-passed` requires the job.
- A Python implementation package covers the JSON contract (T1.27-2): `python/` holds `polyspec-ordered-json` under
  the import name `polyspec.ordered_json`, and the registry, the package test standard and the owner map of the
  repository cover it; `verify.py --only python` passes the official examples, the 98 shared fixtures and the
  package tests, and the rejection positions and kinds agree with every other implementation.
- The documents and the release check name the Python binding (T1.27-3): the API contract gains the Python
  column of every operation table and states its binding extensions, the repository contract counts six
  implementation packages, the feature state and the installation and distribution documents name Python, and the
  release version check reads `python/pyproject.toml` with the other manifests; the package ships no archive, and
  pip installs it from the tag of the repository.
- The repository tools run on Python 3.14 (T1.27-1): `.python-version` names 3.14, the unit tests of the verifier
  pass on it, every workflow that installs Python reads the pin file instead of a release of its own, and the setup
  section of every package README names the pin file.
- A git that reports in the language of the user reads as no work tree (T1.28): `tracked_files` judged the absence
  of a work tree by the English text of git's error, so a localized git turned the records, documentation checks and
  shared cases of a source tree into errors. The `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` call runs with `LC_ALL=C`,
  and AGENTS states the rule for every command whose output text a check judges.

<a id="0-0-3"></a>
## 0.0.3

- The release asset install test installs as a consumer does (T1.26): `scripts/tests/install` holds a `package.json`
  with its `package-lock.json` and a `composer.json` with its `composer.lock`, which record the archives that
  the test builds by name and version only (no `integrity`, an empty `shasum`), and `test_release` runs `npm ci` with an empty cache and the scope `@polyspec` pointed at an unreachable registry and
  `composer install` with an empty `COMPOSER_HOME` and `COMPOSER_CACHE_DIR`, without the offline settings.
  `make install-fixtures` writes the fixtures and their locks. A Composer zip has stored entries, a fixed entry time
  and `TZ=UTC`, so its bytes and its shasum are the same on every machine. AGENTS states that a check makes no
  registry query whose result depends on time and that a download pinned by a lock is installation.
- Release 0.0.3 (T1.25): `package.json`, `js/package.json`, `composer.json`, `php/composer.json`,
  `php-extension/composer.json`, `rust/Cargo.toml` and the package entry of `rust/Cargo.lock` declare 0.0.3, the
  changelogs hold the section `## 0.0.3` under an empty `## Unreleased`, the installation table names 0.0.3, and
  `make release-versions` passes for the tags `v0.0.3` and `go/v0.0.3`, as `test_release` requires.
- Every published `composer.json` declares `version`, because a Composer artifact repository reads the version of the
  manifest (T1.24). `make release-versions` requires X.Y.Z in `composer.json`, `php/composer.json` and
  `php-extension/composer.json`; `make release-assets` fails on a published manifest outside the standard form (no
  `version` in a `composer.json`, `repositories`, `@dev`, `overrides`, a `file:`, `link:`, `workspace:`, URL or git
  dependency, or a polyspec dependency other than one exact version) and on an archive whose manifest differs from its
  source; `make check` requires the standard form of the tree; `test_release` installs the archives in a temporary
  project with npm and with a Composer artifact repository of the zips. The installation guide describes the install
  from the release assets.
- A release body has at most 125000 characters, the limit of GitHub (T1.23). `make release-publish` uses the section
  `## X.Y.Z` of `CHANGELOG.md` as notes when it has at most 125000 characters, and otherwise the one line
  `The changes of X.Y.Z are listed in [CHANGELOG.md](<URL>).`, whose URL is `CHANGELOG.md` at the tag with the anchor
  of the section. `test_release` covers a section over the limit, with and without an `<a id>` anchor, and a section
  of exactly the limit.

### go (packages/go)

- Release 0.0.3 of the repository; the package has no change since 0.0.2.

  (T1.24).


<a id="0-0-2"></a>
## 0.0.2

- Release 0.0.2 (T1.22): `package.json`, `js/package.json`, `rust/Cargo.toml` and the package entry of
  `rust/Cargo.lock` declare 0.0.2, the changelogs hold the section `## 0.0.2` under an empty `## Unreleased`, the
  installation table names 0.0.2, and `make release-versions` passes for the tags `v0.0.2` and `go/v0.0.2`, as `test_release` requires.
- The release of a tag covers the Go module tags at any depth, and its assets are npm tarballs and Composer zips only
  (T1.21-4). The trigger of `.github/workflows/release.yml` is `tags: ['v*', '**/v*']`: in a tag filter `*` does not
  match `/`, so `**/v*` covers `go/vX.Y.Z` and the tag of a Go module at any depth. The Cargo package of `rust/` is
  not released as an archive; it is consumed by git tag, because `cargo package` rewrites git dependencies into
  crates.io requirements that do not resolve. `scripts/release.py` lists it so in its manifests, and
  `test_release` fails on a Cargo archive.
- A tag of a commit of `main` releases it (T1.21-3). `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on the push of a tag `v*` or
  `**/v*` with the permission `contents: write`; `make release-verify` requires the tagged commit on `origin/main` with
  the check runs `push-gate` and `ci-passed` concluded `success`, `make release-versions` the version of the tag in
  every manifest and the section `## X.Y.Z` in `CHANGELOG.md`, `make release-assets` builds the npm and Composer
  archives, and `make release-publish` creates the GitHub Release with the section as notes (`scripts/release.py`,
  `scripts/tests/test_release.py`). AGENTS states the release procedure.
- The ruleset `main` requires exactly the checks `push-gate` and `ci-passed` (T1.21-2). `ci-passed`, the last job of
  `ci.yml`, needs every other job, runs after each of them under `if: ${{ always() }}` and runs `make ci-passed`, which
  fails unless every needed job has the result `success`; a job added to `ci.yml` is required once it is in `needs`.
  `test_workflow_rules` fails when the job is missing, is not last, lacks `if: ${{ always() }}`, does not need every
  other job, runs on another runner or runs another step.
- The changelogs keep the section `## Unreleased` above the released versions (T1.21-1). The entries of the tag
  `v0.0.1` form the section `## 0.0.1`, the changelog of each package has the same two sections, and every change adds
  its entry under `## Unreleased`.
- Each workflow declares its triggers exactly (T1.20): `ci.yml` runs on `pull_request`, `merge_group` and
  `workflow_dispatch`, and `push-gate.yml` on `push` with `branches-ignore: ['gh-readonly-queue/**']`,
  `pull_request` and `merge_group`. `test_workflow_rules` fails when the `on:` block of a workflow differs.

<a id="0-0-1"></a>
## 0.0.1

- The development procedure of each package names the required checks of the repository root (T1.19): development
  runs unit tests only, `make check` of a package runs the shared verifier for that package alone, and hosted CI runs
  the full suite after the push.
- The packages follow the polyspec naming convention (T1.18): Composer `polyspec/ordered-json` and
  `polyspec/ordered-json-extension`, the PHP namespace `Polyspec\OrderedJson` with the extension class
  `Polyspec\OrderedJson\NativeParseError`, npm `@polyspec/ordered-json`, and the Cargo package `polyspec-ordered-json`
  with the library `polyspec_ordered_json`. The Go module `github.com/polyspec/ordered-json/go` already followed it.
- Every change reaches `main` through a pull request and the merge queue (T1.17). The ruleset `main` requires a pull
  request that allows every merge method, the merge queue with the method `REBASE`, a linear history and the checks `push-gate`, `suite` and `docs`,
  without a bypass actor. `ci.yml` and `push-gate.yml` run on `merge_group`, and `ci.yml` not on a push to
  `main`.
- The job `push-gate`, which the ruleset `main` requires, runs `make docs-check` after the gate (T1.16), so a commit
  whose documents, feature tracker or checklist fail their own checks cannot reach `main`.
- A new push cancels the previous CI run of the same ref (T1.15). `ci.yml` declares `concurrency` with group
  `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}` and `cancel-in-progress: true`, because runners are few; `push-gate.yml`
  declares none. `test_workflow_rules` fails on a workflow that runs `make ci` without it.
- `make check` runs clippy and go vet (T1.11). AGENTS required `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` and
  `go vet ./...`, but no command of the full suite ran them. `make check` runs `scripts/lint.py clippy` and
  `scripts/lint.py go-vet` as guard targets of their own after the verification, and `make clippy` and `make go-vet`
  run one. The changed and new cases of `test_full_run` and `test_lint` failed before the change and pass after it.
- The first failure lines of the CI summary name the checker errors (T1.14). The summary of
  `docs-check` showed only the line of make, and the summary of `check` showed passing case lines whose names contain
  `missing`. `scripts/ci_run.py` takes a line that names a file and skips passing case lines and the directory lines
  of make. The new case of `test_ci_run` failed before the change and passes after it.
- The CI summary test compares the summary with the log of the target (T1.13). In CI it failed,
  because it expected the wording of GNU Make 3.81 and the runner's GNU Make 4 names the Makefile line.
- Development runs unit tests only (T1.12). AGENTS and the validation procedure state that `make pie-check`,
  `make check`, `make owner-check`, adapter suites and supplementary suite runs are end-to-end checks that hosted CI
  runs after the push, that no rule requires a local run before a commit or a push, and that the pre-push hook stays a
  fast gate.
- setup-node runs without its npm cache (T1.10). In CI it failed with `Dependencies lock file is
  not found`, because it caches the dependencies of the `packageManager` of `package.json` by default and the
  repository has no lock file. The step sets `package-manager-cache: false`; `test_workflow_rules` fails without it.
- `make ci` and `make ci-summary` parse their job (T1.9). In CI both steps failed with
  `the following arguments are required: --job`, because the remainder argument of the targets also took `--job`, so
  no report was written. `scripts/ci_run.py` splits the targets off at `--` before it parses. The new case of
  `test_ci_run` failed with that error before the change and passes after it.
- A test checks the rules of every workflow (T1.8). `scripts/tests/test_workflow_rules.py` fails, naming the file,
  the job and the step, when a step runs anything but one make target, when a job that runs `make ci` lacks its
  summary or report step under `if: ${{ !cancelled() }}` or has a step that does not run after a failure, when a
  matrix lacks `fail-fast: false`, and on `timeout-minutes`. Applied to `push-gate.yml` before T1.4 it names the
  step that ran `python3 scripts/push_gate.py` directly; the current workflows pass.
- Hosted CI runs the full suite (T1.7). Hosted CI ran only the push gate, so the full suite of a commit ran only on
  a local machine. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every pushed commit of `main` and every pull request on
  `ubuntu-24.04`, where Python 3.9 exists, with the jobs `suite` (`make pie-check`, `make check`) and `docs` in a
  matrix with `fail-fast: false`. Every step runs a make target, also after a failure; `make ci`
  (`scripts/ci_run.py`) runs every target to its end with a log per target, `make ci-summary` writes the job summary
  with the status, the time and the first failure lines of each failed target and copies the records, and the
  report `var/ci/<job>/` is uploaded. The cases of `test_ci_run` failed before the runner existed and pass after it.
- The run of a commit is its evidence; no record is committed (T1.6). `docs/pie-verification.json` and
  `docs/verification.json` hashed every tracked file, so each commit made them stale, the guard of `make check`
  refused until a local `make pie-check` and `make check` regenerated and committed them, and a hosted CI that runs
  the full suite would fail after every commit. `make pie-check` and `make check` write
  `var/records/pie-verification.json` and `var/records/verification.json`, which Git ignores, and the committed
  records are removed. `scripts/docs_check.py --records` checks the records of the checkout, the guard reads no
  record, and a feature names the records section of the validation procedure as its evidence. The changed and new
  cases of `test_docs_check` and `test_full_run` failed before the change and pass after it.
- PHP is pinned by its minor release (T1.5). No tracked file named the PHP of the checks, so a run on another PHP
  verified the tree with a PHP that no pin named. `.php-version` names 8.5, `scripts/toolchains.py` compares the
  major.minor of `php -n -r 'echo PHP_VERSION;'` with it and prints the expected and the actual version, and the
  records name the running patch release. The changed cases of `test_toolchains` failed before the change and pass
  after it.
- The push gate of CI runs through its make target (T1.4). The step of `.github/workflows/push-gate.yml` ran
  `python3 scripts/push_gate.py commit` directly, so the environment and the prechecks of the Makefile did not apply.
  `make push-gate COMMIT=<commit>` runs the gate and fails without `COMMIT`, and the step runs it. The changed and new
  cases of `test_push_gate` failed before the change and pass after it.
- A missing download names `make tools` (T1.3). With the checks offline, a crate that `make tools` did not
  download failed with cargo's advice to retry without `--offline`, a missing PIE PHAR failed `make pie-check` with a
  `FileNotFoundError` traceback, and a missing supplementary suite failed with `--suite must contain test_parsing/`
  or `Supplementary suite is empty`. Every entry point runs `cargo fetch --locked --offline` for `rust/Cargo.lock`
  after the toolchain check and fails with the lock file, the first error line of cargo and `run make tools, which
  downloads them`; `scripts/check_pie.py` and `scripts/test.py` name the missing PHAR or suite and `make tools`
  before any step. The new cases of `test_toolchains` failed before the change and pass after it.
- The checks run offline and only `make tools` downloads (T1.2). cargo, go, npm and Composer ran online in every
  check, so `cargo build --locked` downloaded the crates of `rust/Cargo.lock` on demand, and the PIE PHAR and the
  supplementary suite were downloaded by hand. The Makefile exports `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true`, `GOPROXY=off`,
  `npm_config_offline=true` and `COMPOSER_DISABLE_NETWORK=1`, `scripts/toolchains.py` sets them for every entry
  point, and `make tools` runs with them removed: it installs the Rust toolchain, npm, the crates, the PIE PHAR
  into `.cache/pie/pie.phar` and the supplementary suite into `.cache/JSONTestSuite`, each checked against
  `external-inputs.json`. The new cases of `test_toolchains` failed before the change and pass after it.
- Tasks that are not product features are tracked in the execution checklist
  `docs/plans/execution-checklist.md` (T1.1). The guard of `make check`, the pre-push hook and the push gate read
  only the `partial` features of `docs/features.md`, so such work had no state that stopped a full run or a push.
  Each task has one of the states `[ ]`, `[~]`, `[o]` and `[!] cause: <cause>; retry: <condition>`;
  `scripts/docs_check.py` rejects another state, a row without a task ID, a repeated ID, a checklist without rows
  and a translation whose IDs or states differ, and `scripts/full_run.py` and `scripts/push_gate.py` refuse while a
  task is `[~]` or the checklist cannot be read. The new cases of `test_docs_check`, `test_full_run` and
  `test_push_gate` failed before the change and pass after it.
- Python is pinned by its minor release. `.python-version` named 3.9.6 and `scripts/toolchains.py`
  required that exact release, while CI runs 3.9.25, because `actions/python-versions` builds no
  3.9.6 for `ubuntu-24.04`; local runs and CI followed different rules. An interpreter whose patch
  release cannot be the same locally and on CI is pinned by its minor release: `.python-version`
  names 3.9, the check compares major.minor and prints the expected and the actual version, and the
  aggregate and PIE records name the running patch release in `platform.python`. No check compares
  the PHP patch release. The new cases of `scripts/tests/test_toolchains.py` failed before the
  change, because a 3.9.25 interpreter failed the check, and pass after it; a 3.10 interpreter fails.
- AGENTS.md has the section Idempotency: the same tree gives the same result at any time and on any
  machine, a defect found in one polyspec repository is a class corrected in every repository, and
  one rule per class names how this repository meets it: tools at their tracked versions without
  registry queries or installs on demand, tests that read only their own outputs and tracked files,
  atomic publication, accumulated failures, failures with expected and actual values and the tool's
  error, failing empty selections, process groups reaped and directories removed in `finally`, no
  assertion on human-readable tool output, an owner for every changed file, and leases or per-run
  directories for shared state.
- The build copy of the PHP extension holds only the files Git tracks. `scripts/registry.py`
  copied `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard`, so an untracked file in
  `php-extension/` entered the build of `scripts/verify.py`, `make pie-check` and the benchmark while
  no record named it. The copy uses the tracked list of the source manifest; a tree without Git
  metadata is copied whole, and a tracked symbolic link is still refused. The changed case of
  `scripts/tests/test_run_isolation.py` failed before the change, because the untracked file was
  copied, and passes after it.
- Every tracked path maps to the checks that own it. The new `scripts/owner-checks.json` maps globs
  of paths to verifier unit test modules, implementations that `scripts/verify.py --only` checks, and
  the checks `docs` and `benchmark`; the new `scripts/owner_check.py`, run by `make owner-check`,
  validates the map and runs the owners of the uncommitted changes, of `PATHS` or of the paths changed
  since `BASE`, each to its end. The new pre-commit hook `.githooks/pre-commit` refuses a commit while
  a tracked path matches no rule, a glob matches no path or an owner does not exist, and
  `scripts/push_gate.py` requires it like the pre-push hook: `make hooks-check` fails when it is not
  executable, and CI fails when it is not tracked with mode 100755. Nothing named the tests that own a
  changed file, so the procedure to run only the owning tests depended on reading the sources. The
  cases of the new `scripts/tests/test_owner_check.py` and the new case of
  `scripts/tests/test_push_gate.py` failed before the change, because the map, the check and the hook
  did not exist, and pass after it.
- A build step, a package test command and an adapter end with their whole process group,
  grandchildren included. The group was killed only while the direct child still ran, and the reader
  waited for end of file, so a background process that a command started kept running after it, a
  build step waited for that process without limit, and a package test run failed at the case
  deadline. `scripts/registry.py` reads output with `next_chunk`, which kills the group once the
  command has exited, and `end_group` kills the group in every `finally`. The cases of
  `scripts/tests/test_build_runs.py` and `scripts/tests/test_comparison_runs.py` patched
  `BUILD_SECONDS`, `PIE_SECONDS` and a `timeout` argument that no code has, so the patches changed
  nothing; they now assert that the silent step ran for 2 s or more to its own exit. The cases of the
  new `scripts/tests/test_process_groups.py` failed before the change, because the build step waited
  until the test deadline, the package tests failed at their case deadline and the grandchild of a
  stopped adapter survived, and pass after it.
- Case listings are read in a declared machine format. The listing parser skipped lines by their
  human-readable text (`ok`, `?`, `running`, `test result:`, `FAIL`) for every language, so a line of
  a package's own list that started with `ok` was dropped, and any notice on standard error failed a
  listing that had succeeded. `test_cases` of `implementations.json` declares `format`: `lines` for
  the lists of JavaScript, PHP and the PHP extension, `cargo-terse` for
  `cargo test -- --list --format terse`, and `go-test-json` for `go test -list .* -json`, whose output
  events hold a test name or the summary line of their own package. A line that the format does not
  define fails the listing; a nonzero exit fails it with standard error, and standard error of a
  listing that exits with 0 is printed as tool notices. The `make -n` cases of
  `scripts/tests/test_full_run.py` and `scripts/tests/test_push_gate.py` also remove `GNUMAKEFLAGS`
  and `MAKEFILES` of the caller, which add flags and makefiles to every make. The cases of the new
  `scripts/tests/test_case_listings.py` and the new case of `scripts/tests/test_full_run.py` failed
  before the change, because no format was declared, an `ok` line passed, a notice failed a listing
  and a makefile from `MAKEFILES` printed into the dry run, and pass after it.
- The guard of `make check` and `make rerun-failed` holds `var/full-run.lock` exclusively from its
  first inspection to its end, and refuses, naming the holder, while another guard holds it. Two
  guards started at once both read no record of a running run and both ran the verification of
  one tree. Reading the Makefile no longer writes `core.hooksPath`: every `make` run, including
  `make -n`, set it while it read the Makefile. `make hooks` runs the new
  `scripts/push_gate.py hooks-install`, which writes the configuration only when the value differs
  and then checks the hook, and the guard still refuses a checkout without the hook. The new case of
  `scripts/tests/test_full_run.py` failed before the change, because both guards ran the target,
  and the changed case of `scripts/tests/test_push_gate.py` failed, because `make -n docs-check`
  wrote `core.hooksPath`; both pass after it.
- Failures name what differs. A PIE build or tool error said only "see the PIE output above"; it
  now lists the lines that matched. A stale aggregate or PIE record, and sources that changed during
  a run, said only that the sources differ; each now lists every changed, added and removed file.
  A failing runtime version command and a failing benchmark command lost the tool's standard error;
  both now include the exit status and that error. The `extension_version` runtime command of
  `implementations.json` exited with status 1 and no message when `phpversion('ordered_json')`
  differed from `ORDERED_JSON_VERSION`; it now prints both values. The rule that a refused push
  prints said that CI runs the full verification, which it does not; it now says that CI does not
  run the verification. The `test` scripts of `js/package.json` and `php/composer.json` ran
  `scripts/check.py`, which does not exist; they run `../scripts/verify.py --only js` and
  `--only php`. The cases of the new `scripts/tests/test_failure_messages.py` failed before the
  change, because each message lacked the named lines, files, values or error, and pass after it.
- `benchmarks/run.py` and the comparison script publish their results through `write_record`,
  which renames a complete file over the result. They wrote `benchmarks/results.json`, the review
  copy `.cache/benchmark.current.json` and the comparison report in place, so a
  process that stopped after opening the file left it truncated, and a reader could see part of it.
  `write_record` stages a file inside the repository in `var/`, which Git ignores and no manifest
  reads, instead of a hidden file next to the record in `docs/`. The two interruption cases of the
  new `scripts/tests/test_atomic_publish.py` failed before the change, because a stop right after
  the open left an empty file, and pass after it.
- `make pie-check` compares the hash of the PHAR and the JSONTestSuite checkout with the pins of
  `external-inputs.json` before PIE runs, and `make check` compares the suite before the unit tests.
  Only the documentation check at the end compared them, so a PHAR or a suite checkout other than
  the pinned one spent a whole build and run on a record that the check then rejected. Each field
  that differs fails the command with the expected and the actual value. The pin loader moved from
  `scripts/docs_check.py` to `scripts/verification_record.py`, next to the new `input_issues`. The
  cases of the new `scripts/tests/test_external_pins.py` failed before the change, because PIE ran
  with an unpinned PHAR and suite and the full run started its unit tests with an unpinned suite,
  and pass after it.
- `scripts/test.py --unit` fails with `selected 0 tests` and the name when a name selects no test,
  before any test runs, and the full run fails when it discovers no unit test. `--unit registry`
  loaded the module `scripts/registry.py`, which has no tests, ran 0 tests and exited with status 0,
  so a mistyped selection passed as a test run. The new case of `scripts/tests/test_unit_runner.py`
  failed before the change, because `--unit registry` exited with status 0, and passes after it.
- The push gate and the guard refuse a tracker that yields no feature row. Both read only lines that
  start with `| F-`, so a `docs/features.md` without the feature table, with an empty table or with
  a row whose ID is not `F-...` had no `partial` row, and `scripts/push_gate.py hook` returned no
  refusal. `scripts/docs_check.py` reads the feature table with the new `feature_table`, which
  raises on a missing table, a table without rows and a row that is not a feature, and
  `scripts/full_run.py` and `scripts/push_gate.py` read the rows with it; the push gate refuses the
  push and the guard refuses the run with the reason. The new cases of
  `scripts/tests/test_push_gate.py` and `scripts/tests/test_full_run.py` failed before the change,
  because the hook, the CI command and the guard passed such a tracker, and pass after it.
- Every run checks its tools against tracked pins before any work. Nothing pinned them: a run used
  whatever Node.js, Rust, Go, Python and npm the machine had, go could download the toolchain of
  `go.mod`, rustup could install a toolchain on the first cargo, cargo could rewrite `Cargo.lock`,
  and CI ran on `ubuntu-latest` with actions at moving tags. `.node-version` pins Node.js 26.8.1,
  `rust-toolchain.toml` Rust 1.98.1, the new `toolchain` line of `go/go.mod` Go 1.27.0,
  `.python-version` Python 3.9.6, and `packageManager` of `package.json` npm 12.2.0 with the SHA-512
  of its registry tarball. The new `scripts/toolchains.py` compares each tool with its pin;
  `scripts/test.py`, `scripts/verify.py`, `scripts/check_pie.py` and `benchmarks/run.py` call it
  before their first step and fail with the expected and the actual version, or the error of the
  command, of each tool that differs. `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` and `RUSTUP_AUTO_INSTALL=0` are set by the
  Makefile, the registry and the check, every cargo command uses `--locked`, and runtime versions are
  read in the repository directory, where rustup reads the pin. `make tools` installs the Rust
  toolchain and downloads the npm tarball, refuses it unless its hash matches, and unpacks it without
  links into `.cache/tools/npm`, which comes first on `PATH`; no npm of the machine is used or
  changed. No recipe runs a pinned tool by name, because GNU Make 3.81 looks a simple recipe command
  up on its own `PATH`, not the exported one. CI runs on `ubuntu-24.04` with `actions/checkout` and
  `actions/setup-python` pinned to commits and Python 3.9.25, the last 3.9 release that
  `actions/python-versions` builds for that image; it runs only `scripts/push_gate.py`. The cases of
  the new `scripts/tests/test_toolchains.py` failed before the change, because no pin or check
  existed, the cargo commands had no `--locked` and the workflow used `ubuntu-latest` and tags, and
  pass after it.
- A verification runs every step of every language to its end and reports every failure. The first
  failure ended the run: a failing prepare step raised, the package tests stopped at the first
  failing package, the shared cases stopped at the first mismatch, and `scripts/test.py` returned
  before the builds when a unit test failed, so a second failing language stayed unreported until
  the first was fixed and the whole run started again. `scripts/test.py` now runs the unit tests,
  the build of each language, the case and symbol listings, the package tests, every case of every
  adapter and the runtime versions to their end, lists every failure, and returns 1 without writing a
  record. A failed build skips only the later steps of its own language. `scripts/verify.py --only`
  lists every failure and exits with status 1. `scripts/tests/test_repositories.py` asserted that a
  failing package stopped the verification; it now asserts that the packages after it run and that
  both failing packages are reported. That case and the cases of the new
  `scripts/tests/test_failure_collection.py` failed before the change, because only the first of two
  failing languages was reported, and pass after it.
- Records, documentation checks and shared cases read only the files Git tracks. The source manifest
  of `scripts/verification_record.py` listed `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard` and
  added every match of its source patterns, so an untracked file changed the manifest that a record
  names as the committed tree; `scripts/docs_check.py` walked the directories for Markdown documents
  and JSON reports and counted the fixtures on disk, and `scripts/verify.py` ran every fixture file
  on disk as a shared case. `scripts/registry.py` lists the tracked files with
  `git ls-files --cached`, and each of these reads uses that list; a tree without Git metadata, such
  as a source archive, still reads its files. The guard `scripts/full_run.py` also refuses a full run
  while a file that `.gitignore` does not ignore is untracked, naming each one, because a build reads
  it. The cases of the new `scripts/tests/test_tracked_inputs.py` and the new case of
  `scripts/tests/test_full_run.py` failed before the change, because an untracked file changed the
  manifest, the documents, the reports, the fixtures and the guard decision, and pass after it.
- Every cargo command of a verification run builds into `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` inside that run. The Rust
  probe was `rust/target/debug/examples/probe`, and cargo used the target directory that the
  environment named, so a probe, a test binary or an API listing built by another checkout or an
  earlier tree could answer for the current sources. `implementations.json` declares
  `"env": {"CARGO_TARGET_DIR": "{cache}/rust-target"}` for `rust`, `scripts/registry.py` passes it to
  every prepare step, listing, test and runtime command of the implementation, and the probe is
  `{cache}/rust-target/debug/examples/probe`. `benchmarks/run.py` runs `cargo run` of the Rust
  benchmark with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` inside its run directory. The two new cases of
  `scripts/tests/test_run_isolation.py` failed before the change, because the commands kept an
  inherited `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/shared/target`, and pass after it.
- A push happens only when no feature of `docs/features.md` is `partial`. The pre-push hook
  `.githooks/pre-push` runs `scripts/push_gate.py hook`, which refuses the push while a pushed commit
  or the working tree has a `partial` row, naming each ref, commit, ID and feature, and refuses when
  it cannot read `docs/features.md` of a pushed commit. Every `make` run sets `core.hooksPath` to
  `.githooks` while it reads the Makefile; `make hooks` sets and checks it, and `make hooks-check`
  fails when it is not set or the hook is not executable. The guard `scripts/full_run.py` refuses
  `make check` and `make rerun-failed` while the hook is not installed. The workflow
  `.github/workflows/push-gate.yml` runs `scripts/push_gate.py commit` in the job `push-gate` on every
  pushed branch and pull request, because a push from a checkout without the hook does not run it;
  it fails while a feature is `partial` and when `.githooks/pre-push` is not tracked with mode
  100755. AGENTS stated that the repository had no CI workflow and that nothing refused a push of
  work in progress. `scripts/tests/test_push_gate.py` and the two new cases of
  `scripts/tests/test_full_run.py` failed before the change, because the gate, the hook and the
  workflow did not exist and the guard took no hook state; all 20 cases of both files pass after it.
- `scripts/docs_check.py` fails, with the file, line and column, on an implementation state
  (`implemented`, `partial`, `planned`) written as a code span or a table cell anywhere in
  `docs/features.md` or its translation other than the Implementation cell of a feature row, and on
  a line other than the table in the section of the feature table. `docs/features.md` is the tracker
  that `scripts/full_run.py` reads, and its legend paragraph wrote each state as a code span inside
  that section, so a tool that reads the states saw states outside the feature rows. The legend
  moved to the new section Feature state of AGENTS.md, which defines the states. A state word in
  prose is ordinary English and is not checked. `scripts/tests/test_docs_check.py` failed in its two
  new cases before the change, because a code span, a table cell and a paragraph in the table
  section passed the check; both pass after it, and the check reported line 9 of `docs/features.md`
  and line 10 of the translation before the legend moved.
- `make check` starts the guard `scripts/full_run.py` before the verification. The development
  procedure runs `make check` once, after every active item is complete, and nothing enforced it:
  `make check` started the verification while work was in progress, with uncommitted changes and
  on a tree it had already verified. The guard prints its decision with the reason and refuses
  while a feature of `docs/features.md` is `partial`, listing each ID with its feature, while
  tracked changes are uncommitted, and when `var/full-run.json` records a full run of the current
  tree, naming that run. It runs the verification to its end and writes the record before and
  after it, so a stopped run stays `incomplete`. `make rerun-failed` runs the verification again
  only when the full run of the current tree failed or did not finish. `docs/features.md` defines
  `partial` as work in progress and `planned` as work not started.
  `scripts/tests/test_full_run.py` failed with `No module named 'full_run'` before the change,
  while `make -n check` printed `scripts/test.py` alone; its 10 cases pass with stub targets after
  it.
- Each verification run builds in its own temporary run directory and removes it at the end.
  `make check`, `scripts/verify.py`, the PIE check and the benchmark build the PHP extension
  from a copy of the `php-extension/` source files there, the Go probe is written there, PIE
  works there, and the comparison compiles its Erlang modules there. The extension was
  built in `php-extension/src` with `make distclean`, `phpize` and `configure`, and the Go probe,
  the PIE work directory and the Erlang modules used fixed paths under `.cache/`, so two runs of
  one checkout cleaned or replaced each other's build output while the other run used it. The
  registry key `build_in_copy` selects the copied build; the copy holds tracked and unignored
  files and rejects a symbolic link. The PIE record names the artifact relative to the run
  directory. The ignored output of the former in-place builds (the `phpize`, `configure` and
  `make` files and `modules/` in `php-extension/src`, `.cache/probes` and `.cache/pie-check`) was
  removed from the checkout, since no command reads it.
- The comparison streams the Erlang compile output with its exit status and elapsed time,
  and sends each project one case at a time with the shared 60 s reply deadline, printing each
  case with its elapsed time. The compile had a 45 s limit and each project run one 60 s limit
  for all cases, so a slow compile or a slow whole run failed by the clock, and nothing was
  printed until each command ended.
- Build steps stream their output. Each `prepare` step and each PIE command prints a start line,
  every output line as it arrives, and its exit status with the elapsed time. Both collected the
  output and printed it after the command ended, so the PIE build showed nothing for about 42 s.
- A build step or PIE command has no time limit; its exit status and its output decide the
  result. A deadline of 1500 s per `prepare` step and 4200 s per PIE command killed a healthy
  build that stayed silent past it and failed the run. Package test cases and adapter replies
  keep their 60 s deadlines.
- The verifier sends each adapter one shared case at a time and reads one reply with a deadline
  of 60 s, printing each case with its elapsed time; an adapter that does not reply is killed and
  the case is named. It sent every case at once with one 60 s limit for the whole adapter run,
  so a slow or silent adapter failed without naming a case, and nothing was printed until the
  adapter ended.
- Package tests stream their output. Each case has a deadline of 60 s after the previous result
  line; a runner that passes it is killed with its process group and the verifier reports the
  case it was running, with the elapsed time. The verifier collected all output and printed it
  only when a runner ended, so a hung case showed nothing and the run did not end. The
  JavaScript and PHP runners print `<id> ok|FAIL (<ms>)` for each case. Rust runs with
  `--test-threads=1` and without `--quiet`, so each test name is printed before it runs, and Go
  runs with `-v -p 1`, because `go test` holds the output of each package until it ends when it
  tests several packages in parallel.
- The development procedure runs only the tests that own a change while it is in progress
  (`scripts/verify.py --only`, `scripts/test.py --unit`) and runs `make check` once, after every
  active item is complete. It required `make check` for every change, which reruns every package
  and the shared cases after each correction. Work happens on `main` by default, and a branch or worktree that an agent or the
  situation needs is removed immediately after it is merged.
- The verifier unit tests print each test by name as it starts, then its status and elapsed
  time, and each test has its own deadline, 60 s unless the test declares another; a test past
  its deadline fails by name. The runner printed one dot per test, so a hung test printed nothing
  and the run did not end. `python3 scripts/test.py --unit TEST...` runs only the named
  tests.
- `make docs-check` checks documents only. It compared the verification records with the
  current sources, so after any source edit it failed with "Verification is stale" until the full
  suite ran. `make check` runs the checker with `--records` after it writes the record, so a stale
  verification or PIE record still fails there.
- Remove the root `Cargo.toml`. It defined the `ordered-json` package a second time beside
  `rust/Cargo.toml`, so every Cargo build that depends on this repository warned "skipping duplicate
  package"; Cargo finds `rust/Cargo.toml` in a Git dependency without it. A repository test
  requires one manifest for each Cargo package.
- Format the Rust sources with rustfmt and check the format before every Rust build of
  `make check`. `rust/src/lib.rs` and `rust/tests/api.rs` were not in rustfmt form, and no check
  caught it.
- Declare `ParseError.kind` in the JavaScript type declaration. The parser sets the rejection kind
  on every `ParseError`, but TypeScript callers could not read it without a cast.
- Add the JavaScript `rejectDuplicates` parse option, which rejects repeated decoded object keys
  at every depth with the same offset rule in UTF-16 units. The default parse is unchanged.
- Add a PHP parse that rejects repeated decoded object keys at every depth, with the same
  offset rule as the Rust strict byte parser. `Value::parse` retains its documented result.
- Pin the typed Rust binding dependencies to the verified versions. The binding writes raw JSON
  through the Serde JSON token protocol, so a dependency update requires its package tests.
- Accept `package-tests` as a feature verification state when the verification record contains
  the implementation's test result. The Rust minimum is 1.71 because the current test dependency
  requires it.
- Add typed Rust Serde encoding and decoding. Structure fields retain declaration order and
  wire and manifest fixtures fix output bytes; embedded `Value` fields retain object order and
  number tokens; malformed, repeated and unknown input fails.
- Add a Rust byte parser that rejects repeated decoded object keys at every depth. Callers that
  require every input member can select it while the normal parser retains its documented result.
- Disable Cargo registry publication for the Rust package. The package has no declared Rust
  license, and the source checkout is its confirmed distribution.
- Fixed Go `Marshal` for a nil `*Value` field: it now writes `null`, as it does for other nil pointers, instead of returning `expected orderedjson Value`. The nil check runs before the `MarshalJSON` boundary, so any nil pointer whose type implements `MarshalJSON` is `null`, and an interface is encoded as the value it holds.
- The benchmark runner now validates each fixture's declared object, array,
  scalar, node, and maximum-depth counts against the parsed input. Added
  regression tests for correct metadata, node counting, and depth mismatch
  rejection.
- Every benchmark harness warms up for a declared duration as well as a declared iteration count, and the runner no longer prints that it saved the committed result when it kept a failed measurement out of it. A warm-up counted only in iterations ended in microseconds on the small fixtures, so whichever fixtures a process measured first read 1.5 to 1.7 times slower, `serde_json` included; reversing the fixture order moved the slowdown with the position, not with the fixture. The recorded protocol now carries the warm-up duration, so results measured under the earlier protocol are not comparable and the baseline was measured again.
- The registry declares the repository URL once. The same value sat in `implementations.json` five times, once per package, and as a literal in both the registry loader and the documentation checker, so a source observation was compared against a constant rather than against a declaration. It is now compared against the one the registry makes.
- A feature names the record that backs the state it claims, and a benchmark result is evidence only when it was measured from a clean checkout, with the protocol and inputs `workload.json` declares. The earlier rule required every verified feature to link `verification.json`, which says nothing about benchmarks, so `F-BENCHMARK` cited a record holding no measurement at all. The committed result had been measured from a dirty tree sixty commits earlier, so the sources it described could not be established, and it was measured again. A result is a record rather than a source, so re-measuring no longer makes the aggregate verification record stale.
- A verification record keeps only values something can check. External inputs, the PIE tool and the supplementary suite, are pinned in `external-inputs.json` and compared with the record. The recorded extension artifact hash was removed: a linked module receives a fresh identifier and signature, so no rebuild reproduced it, the value could not be wrong, and `make pie-check` rewrote the committed record on every run. The record now names the artifact by the path the registry declares, a declaration nothing read until now. A test changes every recorded hash in turn and requires the check to fail, so a value nothing can falsify cannot return.
- A parse error carries a rejection kind from one shared list, and the shared check requires every implementation to name the same kind for the same document. Message wording stays in each language's own style: Go and Rust keep lowercase sentences, and JavaScript keeps its finer wording for number errors.
- Every package reports its public symbols, and the standard names the cases that cover each one. The comparison found four gaps: Go `ParseBytesBorrowed` had no test, Rust `OrderedMap::iter` and `stringify` were never called by a case, and the JavaScript type declaration described a `stringify` options argument the function does not take.
- The shared check compares where each implementation rejects an input, and every implementation now reports the first byte that makes the document invalid. The comparison found five documents whose positions differed: JavaScript, Go and both PHP backends pointed one byte past an unescaped control character, and pure PHP pointed at the start of an invalid Unicode escape instead of the offending byte.
- Added a package test standard and the check that enforces it. Each implementation reports the cases it runs, and `make check` fails when a required case is missing or a reported case is not declared, so cross-language coverage is decided by the tool rather than by review.
- An invalid UTF-8 error reports the first invalid byte in every implementation. JavaScript and Go reported offset 0 while Rust and both PHP backends reported the byte, and no shared case compared the position. Package tests now require the rule in every implementation.
- The JavaScript package declares its own tests for the value API, which no shared case can reach. Every implementation package now declares package tests.
- The Rust package declares its own tests for the value API, which no shared case can reach.
- Fixed the PHP unpaired-surrogate error, which raised a class-not-found error instead of `UnexpectedValueException` because the exception name was unqualified inside the namespace. The PHP package now declares its own tests, which found it.
- The PHP extension package declares its own tests for the descriptor API, which no shared case can reach.
- The API contract states the rule for an API that only one binding provides: it uses the shared parser and serializer, leaves results, errors, and offsets unchanged, appears in the binding extensions section, and is covered by its package's declared tests. Go `Marshal` is documented there.
- The implementation registry declares each package's own test command, `make check` runs the declared commands, and the verification record requires their results. Shared cases run through adapters and cannot reach a language-specific API, so a defect in one survived while every shared case passed.
- Corrected Go `Marshal` omission rules and error reporting: `omitempty` and `omitzero` are separate rules, non-finite floats name the field that holds them, and the unreachable `time.Time` branch is removed. A seeded randomized test compares 20,000 values with the host encoder's decoded structures.
- Fixed Go `Marshal`: anonymous struct fields contributed no fields, a repeated field name silently lost a field, and a cyclic value recursed until the process died. Promotion now matches Go field promotion, repeated names and values deeper than the parser's limit are errors.
- PHP object hydration creates one value per member instead of two; serialization reads key tokens from the descriptor. Parse followed by full traversal took 0.85-0.99 of the previous time with the extension and 0.90-1.00 in pure PHP, with identical results.
- Added the Go `Marshal` binding for typed struct, map, slice, scalar, time and byte values. It validates custom marshaler output through ordered-json and produces compact JSON without using the host JSON encoder.
- Kept PHP container serialization out of `compact()`, whose larger call frame had made extension stringify about 1ns slower after the accessor changes. Extension stringify now takes 0.92-0.95 of the time before those changes.
- The PHP extension creates child `Value` objects in C with `ordered_json_hydrate()` instead of a PHP loop. Parse followed by full traversal took 0.65-0.99 of the previous time with the extension; parse, stringify, and round trip stayed within 0.99-1.02, with identical results.
- Rust root arrays take the parser's pending item stack instead of copying every item, releasing spare capacity above one quarter of the length. Parsing root arrays of 90 and 110,000 numbers took 0.84-0.85 of the previous time, with identical results.
- Reduced PHP value access cost: accessors read the descriptor tape directly instead of chaining helper calls, child values are created without a promoted constructor, and escaped strings decode to UTF-8 without an intermediate UTF-16 unit array. Parse followed by full traversal took 0.43-0.89 of the previous time with the extension and 0.60-0.97 in pure PHP, with identical results.
- Stopped freezing JavaScript `Value` objects during parsing. Values still cannot be modified through the library API because their state is held in private fields; returned item and key arrays remain frozen. The API contract now states this guarantee.
- Removed the PHP `useNative` parse option, `parseNative()`, the unused PHP `stringify()` compact flag, the unused JavaScript `stringify()` options argument, and the native `ordered_json_compact()` function. PHP uses the extension when it is loaded and the pure implementation otherwise.
- Fixed pure PHP UTF-8 validation that rejected valid input under very low PCRE backtrack or recursion limits, and reduced pure PHP parser overhead by passing offsets through local variables.
- Documented running `make pie-check` before `make check` after source changes, because the documentation check rejects a stale PIE record.
- Reduced per-value parser and serializer work in every implementation without changing results, errors, or offsets. JavaScript checks values with a private-field brand instead of a `WeakSet` registry, slices unescaped strings from the source, and creates object key tokens on access. Go allocates values in chunks and decodes string units on access. Rust stores kind-specific payloads instead of an empty hash map, item vector, and unit vector per value. The PHP library and extension use an integer descriptor tape, and the extension validates UTF-8 while scanning strings instead of in a separate pass. Values without insignificant whitespace or duplicate keys serialize by copying their source token. Differential tests compared parse results, errors, offsets, accessors, factories, and serialization with the previous implementations. The PHP descriptor format is described in the [API contract](docs/spec/api.md#php).
- Fixed benchmark execution to use Rust release builds, fixed workload input digests, repeated samples, median/p95 statistics, environment fingerprints, and committed results.
- Preserved the committed benchmark baseline when a comparable run exceeds its tolerance and recorded failed measurements separately for review.
- Corrected the native macOS deployment target and bundle configuration to remove the obsolete `-single_module` and `-undefined suppress` linker warnings.
- Added PIE artifact verification using the same shared JSON cases and separate PHP and extension version records.
- Updated the Go module to `github.com/polyspec/ordered-json/go`.
- Added `make distclean` before repeated native setup because moved dependency files retained the previous build path.
- Added a registry of implementation build, adapter, and runtime commands.
- Separated PHP extension sources into `php-extension/src` and added PIE package metadata with a default-enabled standalone build.
- Removed host JSON parser and serializer dependencies from core value construction and string handling, and added shared repeated round-trip verification across all implementations.
- Added reproducible cross-language performance benchmarks against runtime-native JSON APIs.
- Added a fixed workload manifest and strict benchmark row, input-size, and output-size checks.
- Removed native PHP extension re-parsing during serialization and reduced repeated ordered-map lookups in the Go and Rust implementations.
- Optimized JavaScript serialization and Unicode escape parsing, lazily hydrated PHP descriptor children, removed avoidable Rust serializer cache allocations, and added the explicit zero-copy Go `ParseBytesBorrowed` API.
- Set the unreleased package and extension version to `0.0.1`; no release or automation is configured.

- Renamed language packages, namespaces, imports, native symbols, and build outputs to the ordered-json identifiers in the [API contract](docs/spec/api.md).
- Added English canonical documents and paired Korean translations for specifications, APIs, feature state, operations, examples, and development procedure.
- Added `make check` and `make docs-check`. Checks validate document registration, links, translation revisions, section/code parity, feature state, and current verification evidence. Verification records now include the actual source hashes, runtime versions, and common test results.
- Rebuild the PHP extension from clean phpize outputs because copied read-only build files prevented repeated setup. Build error diagnostics now stop verification even when the tool returns a zero exit status.
- Moved the requested comparison into `docs/reports/` and normalized compiler diagnostic paths to source-relative paths.
- Changed JSON objects to ordered associative maps. Duplicate keys now overwrite the value while retaining the first key position, so each decoded key has one value. Removed the duplicate lookup and member-list APIs. Default serialization now emits the associative object; source inspection remains available separately.
- Added JavaScript, Rust, Go, pure PHP, and PHP extension implementations with strict parsing, recursive document order, exact number tokens, and construction APIs.
- Centralized official inputs and expected results in [official.json](examples/official.json), with shared grammar fixtures and optional supplementary inputs.
- Verified every implementation with 433 shared cases. The PIE-built artifact also passed all 433 cases; 42 checker tests passed. That earlier run recorded two PHP build-tool linker deprecation warnings in its verification record.

The current verification record identifies the tested source and results for all five implementations and the documentation checker tests. Distribution observations are separate. This entry records development changes and does not declare a package release.

### npm (packages/js)

- The npm package is `@polyspec/ordered-json`, the polyspec convention; it was `ordered-json`.
- The package test runner writes each case id before the case runs and `ok` or `FAIL` with the elapsed milliseconds after it, with synchronous writes, so the verifier can name a case that does not end. Unreachable code after the run that listed the cases a second time is removed.
- Add the `rejectDuplicates` parse option for callers that require every decoded object key to occur once. It reports `Duplicate object key` with kind `duplicate_object_key` at the second key's UTF-16 offset, requires a boolean, and keeps the default parse unchanged. `ParseOptions` lists each field on its own line so the package reports both fields for the coverage check.
- `ParseError` carries a `kind` from the shared rejection list beside its own message.
- Removed the `StringifyOptions` declaration and the second `stringify` parameter from the type declaration; the function takes one argument. The package reports its public symbols for the shared coverage check.
- An unescaped control character is reported at its own offset instead of one past it, and the adapter reports the rejection position for the shared comparison.
- `parseBytes` reports the byte offset of the first invalid byte instead of 0, and the message names the unit because this error has no UTF-16 position.
- Added package tests for the value API and declared them in the implementation registry: construction guards, frozen item and key arrays, a fresh member map per access, wrong-kind access, key type checking, option validation, `parseBytes` input checks, UTF-16 parse offsets, code units for unpaired surrogates, and factory arguments. Shared cases reach this package through its adapter and do not cover that surface.
- Stopped calling `Object.freeze` on each parsed `Value`; private fields keep values unmodifiable through the API, and `items` and `keys` arrays remain frozen.
- Removed the unused `stringify()` options argument.
- Reduced parser and serializer overhead: values use a private-field brand check instead of a `WeakSet` registry, unescaped strings are sliced from the source, object key tokens are created on access, and values without insignificant whitespace or duplicate keys serialize as their source token. Results, errors, and offsets are unchanged.
- Added the package's own development procedure, changelog, Makefile and documentation manifest.
- Added English and Korean usage, development, and change records.

Common JSON behavior is unchanged. Verification records are generated by `make check`; aggregate evidence is described in the [verification records](https://github.com/polyspec/ordered-json/blob/main/docs/operations/validation.md#records) of the repository root. Registry publication is not declared here.

### rust (packages/rust)

- The Cargo package is `polyspec-ordered-json` and the library `polyspec_ordered_json`, the polyspec convention;
  they were `ordered-json` and `ordered_json`.
- Pin the Serde binding dependencies to the verified versions because raw JSON values use the
  Serde JSON token protocol.
- Set Rust minimum to 1.71 to match the current JSON test dependency.
- Add Serde typed encoding and decoding. Struct fields retain declaration order; wire and
  manifest fixtures fix the bytes, embedded `Value` fields retain object order and number
  tokens, and invalid or unconsumed input fails.
- Add `parse_bytes_reject_duplicates` for callers that require every decoded object key to
  occur once. It returns the second key's byte offset and keeps the normal parser unchanged.
- `Error::kind` names the rejection with the shared identifier.
- Package tests call `OrderedMap::iter` and `stringify`, and the package reports its public symbols for the shared coverage check.
- An invalid escape is reported at the escape character instead of one byte past it, and the adapter reports the rejection position for the shared comparison.
- Added package tests for the value API and declared them in the implementation registry: the depth argument bound, `parse_bytes` UTF-8 offsets, `OrderedMap` key validation and repeated keys, member lookup by decoded name, unpaired surrogate units, constructor arguments, and wrong-kind access. Shared cases reach this package through its adapter and do not cover that surface.
- Root arrays take the pending item stack instead of copying every item; spare capacity above one quarter of the length is released.
- Reduced parser allocations: each value stores a kind-specific payload instead of an empty map, item vector, and unit vector; string units are decoded on first access; objects keep one entry list and build a hash index above eight members; values without insignificant whitespace or duplicate keys compact by copying their source token. Results, errors, and offsets are unchanged. The derived `Debug` output of `Value` and `OrderedMap` reflects the new internal fields.
- Added the package's own development procedure, changelog, Makefile and documentation manifest.
- Added English and Korean usage, development, and change records.

Common JSON behavior is unchanged.

### go (packages/go)

- `Marshal` writes `null` for a nil `*Value` and for any other nil pointer whose type implements `MarshalJSON`, and encodes an interface as the value it holds. It previously called `MarshalJSON` on the nil pointer and returned `expected orderedjson Value`.
- `ParseError.Kind` names the rejection with the shared identifier.
- Added a package test for `ParseBytesBorrowed`: text handed back survives a change to the caller's bytes. The package reports its public symbols for the shared coverage check.
- An unescaped control character is reported at its own offset instead of one past it, and the adapter reports the rejection position for the shared comparison.
- Parsing reports the byte offset of the first invalid UTF-8 sequence instead of 0.
- `Marshal` applies `omitempty` and `omitzero` as separate rules, matching the host encoder: a zero `time.Time` stays under `omitempty` and is dropped under `omitzero`. Non-finite floats report the field that holds them instead of failing later in the parser, and the unreachable `time.Time` branch is removed because `time.Time` carries its own `MarshalJSON`. A seeded randomized test compares decoded structures with the host encoder.
- `Marshal` now contributes the fields of anonymous struct fields instead of dropping them, reports a repeated field name as an error instead of emitting a duplicate key, and stops at the parser's nesting limit so a cyclic value returns an error instead of exhausting memory.
- Reduced parser allocations: values are allocated in chunks sized from document separators, string units are decoded on access, objects with up to eight members use linear key lookup, and values without insignificant whitespace or duplicate keys compact by copying their source token. Text returned by `Compact` and `StringValue` for `ParseBytesBorrowed` input is copied. Results, errors, and offsets are unchanged.
- Added the package's own development procedure, changelog, Makefile and documentation manifest.
- Added English and Korean usage, development, and change records.
- Updated the Go module and probe import to `github.com/polyspec/ordered-json/go`.

### php (packages/php)

- The Composer package is `polyspec/ordered-json` and the namespace is `Polyspec\OrderedJson`, the polyspec convention; they were `ordered-json/ordered-json` and `OrderedJson`. The suggested extension is the PIE package `polyspec/ordered-json-extension`.
- The package test runner writes each case id before the case runs and `ok` or `FAIL` with the elapsed milliseconds after it, so the verifier can name a case that does not end. The `--cases` listing runs the checks without those lines and prints case ids only.
- Add `Value::parseRejectDuplicates` for callers that require every decoded object key to occur once. It reports `Duplicate object key` with kind `duplicate_object_key` at the second key's byte offset, parses with the PHP parser in both backends, and keeps `Value::parse` unchanged.
- `ParseError` carries a `kind` from the shared rejection list beside its own message.
- The package reports its public symbols for the shared coverage check; the UTF-8 offset helper is marked internal like the other helpers.
- An unescaped control character is reported at its own offset, an invalid Unicode escape at the first byte that is not a hex digit, and the adapter reports the rejection position for the shared comparison.
- An unpaired surrogate raises `UnexpectedValueException` again. Inside the namespace the unqualified name resolved to a missing `OrderedJson\UnexpectedValueException`, so `stringValue()` and UTF-8 conversion raised a class-not-found error instead.
- Added package tests for accessor errors, UTF-16 units, member lookup, factory arguments, parse error offsets, and UTF-8 validation under low PCRE limits, and declared them in the implementation registry. Shared cases reach this package through its adapter and do not cover that surface.
- Object hydration no longer creates a second value for each key token; serialization pairs members with key tokens read from the descriptor.
- Moved PHP container serialization out of `compact()` into a private method, so serializing with the extension uses a smaller call frame. Extension stringify took 0.92-0.95 of the time before the current accessor changes.
- Child values are created by `ordered_json_hydrate()` when the extension is loaded.
- Reduced value access cost by reading the descriptor tape directly in accessors, creating child values without a promoted constructor, and decoding escaped strings to UTF-8 without an intermediate UTF-16 unit array.
- Removed the `useNative` parse option, `parseNative()`, and the unused `stringify()` compact flag; `parse()` uses the extension when it is loaded.
- Fixed UTF-8 validation that rejected valid input under very low PCRE backtrack or recursion limits, and reduced parser overhead by passing offsets through local variables.
- Changed the internal descriptor to the integer tape shared with the extension. The parser scans whitespace, digits, and string runs with byte-span functions, string units are decoded on access, and values without insignificant whitespace or duplicate keys serialize by copying their source token. Results, errors, and offsets are unchanged.
- Added the package's own development procedure, changelog, Makefile and documentation manifest.
- Added English and Korean usage, development, and change records.
- Moved the native extension to the `php-extension` package; the PHP library remains independently usable.

### php-ext (packages/php-ext)

- The PIE package is `polyspec/ordered-json-extension`, and the error class is `Polyspec\OrderedJson\NativeParseError`; they were `ordered-json/ordered-json-extension` and the global class `OrderedJsonNativeParseError`. Hydration creates `Polyspec\OrderedJson\Value`.
- The package test runner writes each case id before the case runs and `ok` or `FAIL` with the elapsed milliseconds after it, so the verifier can name a case that does not end. The `--cases` listing runs the checks without those lines and prints case ids only.
- `OrderedJsonNativeParseError` carries a `kind` from the shared rejection list.
- The package reports its functions, constant and error class for the shared coverage check.
- An unescaped control character is reported at its own offset instead of one past it.
- Added package tests for the descriptor API and declared them in the implementation registry. They cover hydrated members and items, repeated and escaped member names, malformed descriptors rejected with `ValueError`, compact token copying, the supported depth range, and the reported parse error offset. Shared cases reach the extension only through the PHP Value API, so these are the only checks of that surface.
- `ordered_json_hydrate()` returns an object's members alone; it no longer creates a value for each key token.
- Added `ordered_json_hydrate()`, which creates the child `OrderedJson\Value` objects of a container from a descriptor and rejects a descriptor that does not match the source with `ValueError`. Hydration is compiled from a separate `hydrate.c`; the class lookup is cached for each request.
- Removed `ordered_json_compact()`; the PHP library serializes with `ordered_json_compact_node()`.
- Replaced associative descriptor arrays with an integer tape, validated UTF-8 while scanning strings instead of in a separate pass while still reporting invalid UTF-8 before other errors, and serialized compact subtrees with one copy. `ordered_json_compact_node` accepts a descriptor index and rejects a descriptor that does not match the source with `ValueError`. The format is described in the [API contract](https://github.com/polyspec/ordered-json/blob/main/docs/spec/api.md#php). Parse results, errors, and offsets are unchanged.
- Corrected macOS bundle configuration: derive an omitted deployment target from the compiler and omit the unused dynamic-library single-module flag check. This removes the obsolete `-single_module` and `-undefined suppress` linker warnings.
- Added the package's own development procedure, changelog, Makefile and documentation manifest.
- Added English and Korean usage, development, and change records.
- Added PIE `php-ext` metadata, a `src` build path, and an enabled standalone build by default.
