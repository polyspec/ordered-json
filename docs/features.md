## Verification and distribution limits

The previous native macOS and PIE records are not current evidence. A new PIE record will be created only after a local PHAR is available and `make pie-check` passes.

Passing shared cases establishes their recorded acceptance criteria. It does not establish exhaustive input coverage, all declared minimum runtimes, all platforms, or every host encoder integration. See [verification limits](operations/validation.md#limits). Source metadata contains development version strings. A row marked `published` names the release tag and the asset of its GitHub release; `make evidence-check` checks that form.

The committed benchmark timings are retained for historical comparison. They are not claimed as current verification evidence until T2.48 has a reliable idle-machine remeasurement.
